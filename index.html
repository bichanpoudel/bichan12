            <h3>affordable hotels</h3>
            <p>When it comes to hospitality in Nepal, it is not only limited to hotels and restaurants. People have also started the concept of homestay. Homestays are a popular form of hospitality where visitors stay in a residence with the locals of the place where they are travelling.</p>

            <h3>food and drinks</h3>
            <p>Indeed, a vast range of flavours can be found just in daal bhaat, the national dish of rice, lentils, lightly curried vegetables and pickles; though it can also, sometimes, be disappointingly bland. In the Kathmandu Valley, the indigenous Newars have their own unique cuisine of spicy meat and vegetable dishes, while a vast range of Indian curries, breads, snacks and sweets comes into play in the Terai; in the high mountains, the traditional diet consists of noodle soups, potatoes and toasted flour. “Chow-chow” packet noodles, cooked up as a spicy soup snack, are ubiquitous. Vegetarians will feel at home in Nepal, since meat is considered a luxury. Tourist menus invariably include veggie items.

Outside the tourist areas food is very inexpensive, and a simple meal and drink may well set you back less than Rs100. In places like Kathmandu and Pokhara, however, costs can quickly add up: you might pay around Rs250–500 for a main meal at a tourist-oriented restaurant, and even more at a posher place. Note that few restaurants include government taxes (13 percent) and service charges (10 percent) in their menu prices.</p>

            <h3>safty guide</h3>
            <p>Nepal, a country most famous for its trekking, mountain climbing and adventure sports, also a host to the tallest mountains in the world, the Everest, the safety in Nepal is quite good contrary to many beliefs. It is quite isolated from the rest of the world, apart from its tourism industry, which brings in most of the revenue as well. There are just a few things you should keep in mind as an outsider to have a smooth experience since the culture and traditions of this country are still intact due to its isolation. People are quite religious here, which also makes it safer than most western countries at times. Since tourism is the main economic foundation of the country, tourists are bound to be treated well. But still, there are a few things you should always keep in mind.</p>

Flying is the transport of choice for a lot of visitors. It's certainly the fastest way to travel across Nepal. When faced with the prospect of a cramped 24-hour bus ride, shelling out USD $100 for an internal flight certainly seems like a small price to pay!</p>

            <p>Adventure in Nepal - "Unusual Experience"

Here, you and your family and friends will surely enjoy a vacation that can relieve you of the stress brought by the daily grind. Look for the best flight deals to Nepal and visit here now so that you can witness the awe-inspiring and world-famous Himalayas.

Adventure travel is one of the fastest growing but least understood forms of international tourism. Nepal is one among the best destinations in the world for adventure tourism which offers an excess of outdoor activities from Paragliding near the mountains to waiting for the Bengal tiger in the dense forest of Chitwan. The history of adventure tourism in Nepal starts from the early attempts to ascend world’s highest peak Mt. Everest some about five decades ago. The role of Adventure Tourism in the economic development of remote areas and its impact on local community, economy, and the environment are not fully figured out, even though adventure tourism has been adopted enthusiastically by many countries like Nepal. Here we are not to analyze the impact of adventure tourism in Nepal but we believe that adventure travel will bring many positive impacts on Nepal's national economy, indigenous populations, tourism industry, and conservation development. With its steady growth, adventure tourism in Nepal will play an increasingly important role for national and local development in the frontier areas.</p>

                    <h3>Miss.S</h3>
                    <p>A Perfect 10 Days in Nepal

I truly had an amazing time. Kirpa organized the perfect trip which included a trek through the Himalayas and a short 2 day visit to the Chitwan National Park. My trek was exactly what I wanted-challenging! I was able to enjoy breathtaking views of the Himalayas. My guide and porter (both named Pemba) were professional, energetic, supportive and kind. I could not have asked for a better team.

I also greatly appreciated Kirpa's agility. She was nimble on her feet when my flight to Chitwan begin was canceled. She quickly arranged for a driver and I was on my way, having lost little time.

Thank you to the whole Himalayan Treks team. I had a trip of a lifetime.</p>

                    <h3>Miss.A</h3>
                    <p>Yogesh has been very good and helpful, he made my whole trip. Everything went exactly as in the itinerary, except for a minor mistake on Temple Tree Hotel check out and pick up time. The hotel staff told me the wrong time which was one and half hour earlier than the arranged. The last day photograph tour was the best, far beyond my exception. The guide was a super kind and knowledgeable gentleman. He was the best during this trip.

Overall, great experience. I will surely consider Social Tour next time in Nepal.</p>

                    <h3>Miss.B</h3>
                    <p>I had a 5 days break from work and decided to visit Nepal. From the onset of the trip, I had support from Kripa who provided me with a packed program that captured all of historical and cultural places in the Kathmandu Valley. It was a mesmerising experience made perfect by the local guide Rajiv who was able to give me many insights and information about Nepal. I visited temples, palaces, museums but the highlight of my trip was a hike in the mountain.</p>
